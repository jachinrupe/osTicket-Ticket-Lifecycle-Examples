  First we can go to the OS ticket tab and login as one of the created users

  Then we can logout and switch users and create a new ticket

So once the tickets are created, we can login as Jane and see the tickets.
For the first ticket, we can actually assign it to John so he can handle it a little bit later.
Before we do that, we can actually set the priority level and SLA if we want to.

We can assign tickets to other members or even assign to ourselves and set priorities and SLA's accordingly.

If we keep a ticket open, we can respond in e-mail what instructions will occur in order to resolve the problem.

But if some time has passed, we can resolve the ticket as well.

These are just some examples of how osticket can produce tickets for a company.
